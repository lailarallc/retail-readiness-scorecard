# Retail Readiness Scorecard — Current Work Plan

The current arc of work. Updated when the arc changes, not every
session. For session-by-session state, see HANDOFF.md.

---

## Goal

Build and ship a fully functional single-file HTML retail readiness scorecard tool — offline, branded, PDF-exportable — covering Walmart, Costco, and Whole Foods.

## Why this arc, why now

All planning is done. Requirements, retailer specs, and tech decisions are locked. The only thing left is building it.

## Business question this arc answers

For a $3M–$20M specialty food brand, how ready are you for your target retailer launch — and where are the specific gaps that need to be fixed before you say yes to the buyer?

## Tasks

### U1 — Vite scaffold + fonts + .gitignore fix ✅
- [x] `npm init -y`, install Vite, vite-plugin-singlefile v2.3.0, jsPDF v4
- [x] Install Fontsource packages: `@fontsource/playfair-display`, `@fontsource/source-sans-3`
- [x] Configure `vite.config.js` with viteSingleFile({ useRecommendedBuildConfig: true, removeViteModuleLoader: true })
- [x] Create `src/` directory structure: `index.html`, `main.js`, `fonts.css`, `styles/`, `fonts/`, `data/`, `engine/`, `ui/`
- [x] Copy woff2 font files into `src/fonts/` (NOT public/)
- [x] Add `!dist/retail-readiness-scorecard.html` negation to `.gitignore`
- [x] Verify `npm run build` produces `dist/retail-readiness-scorecard.html` under 600KB with no external requests

### U2 — CSS design system ✅
- [x] Lailara design tokens (colors, type scale, spacing) as CSS custom properties
- [x] Intro screen layout
- [x] Question screen layout (single question + 3 options)
- [x] Results screen layout (callout card + bar chart + dimension cards)
- [x] Dark callout card component
- [x] Mobile responsive (320px minimum)
- [x] Fade transition between questions (respects prefers-reduced-motion)

### U3 — Retailer data + scoring engine ✅
- [x] Create `scoring_engine/` with YAML files for Walmart, Costco, Whole Foods
- [x] Write `score.py` that reads YAML and scores a set of answers
- [x] Port scoring logic to `src/engine/scoring.js` (same rules, browser-runnable)
- [x] Unit tests (Vitest) covering all 3 retailers, gate question behavior, Red/Yellow/Green thresholds
- [x] Whole Foods Compliance hard gate logic (prohibited ingredients or missing GFSI cert → forced Red)

### U4 — Question bank + flow engine ✅
- [x] Write all ~24 questions in `src/data/questions.js` (retailer-specific language, 3 options each)
- [x] Flow state machine in `src/engine/flow.js`: tracks current question, answers, branching, gate detection
- [x] Gate question logic: Red gate answer → score dimension Red, skip follow-up questions
- [x] Unit tests (Vitest) covering branching paths, gate skips, full 12–18 question completion

### U5 — Intro + question screen UI ✅
- [x] Intro screen: title, one-sentence framing, Start button
- [x] Retailer selection screen (Walmart / Costco / Whole Foods)
- [x] Brand name input
- [x] Question screen: renders current question + 3 options, advances on selection
- [x] Progress indicator (subtle — no dimension labels visible during assessment)
- [x] Wires up to flow engine and scoring engine

### U6 — Results screen + SVG bar chart ✅
- [x] Overall verdict callout card (dark background): verdict text, top 3 blockers, remediation timeline estimate
- [x] SVG horizontal bar chart: one bar per dimension, fill width = numeric score %, color = R/Y/G
- [x] Dimension cards below chart: status badge, findings, one-line "what to fix"
- [x] Hard gate note on forced-Red dimensions
- [x] Results screen fully renders from scoring engine output

### U7 — jsPDF export ✅
- [x] Import TTF fonts via Vite `?base64` query, register with jsPDF VFS
- [x] Programmatic PDF layout: verdict card, bar chart (SVG coordinates → jsPDF rects), dimension cards
- [x] Export PDF button wired up
- [x] Filename pattern: `retail-readiness-{brand}.pdf`
- [x] Multi-page support with continuation headers and correct page count footers

## Out of scope for this arc

- UNFI and KeHE retailer scoring (YAML structure will accommodate post-MVP)
- CSV upload for automated Product Data scoring
- Additional retailers (Target, Sprouts, regional chains)
- User accounts, saved assessments, result persistence
- Backend scoring API
- Email gating

## Definition of done for this arc

- [x] `npm run build` produces a single `dist/retail-readiness-scorecard.html` (395KB gzip, under 600KB budget)
- [x] File opens from local filesystem with no internet connection — zero network requests
- [x] Full assessment completes for all 3 retailers (Walmart, Costco, Whole Foods)
- [x] Gate questions correctly skip follow-up questions and score Red immediately
- [x] Results screen shows SVG bar chart + dimension cards + dark callout card
- [x] Export PDF generates a clean vector PDF with Playfair/SourceSans fonts
- [ ] PDF cross-browser test: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge (next session)
- [x] All Vitest unit tests pass for scoring engine and flow engine (37/37)
- [x] YAML scoring artifacts committed to `scoring_engine/`

## Improvement history

Track when this project was reviewed and improved via /improve.
Each entry records what was found, what was fixed, and when to
check again.

<!-- Entries are added by /improve — don't delete this section -->

### 2026-07-31 — Improvement pass — COMPLETE

- **Trigger:** User-initiated (code review + UI review). Verify CEO/CFO-ready.
- **Reviewed:** scoring engine (vs YAML + Python), flow, questions, renderers,
  PDF, tests; correctness/security/testing reviewers + live browser runs.
- **Headline:** Scoring math verified correct — no drift from the audited spec.
  All issues were presentation-layer.
- **Fixed:** C1 (no blank Red/Yellow cards), I1 (no green padding in Top
  Priorities), intro copy (≤30s comprehension), I4 (absolute links), I2/I3
  (partial/boundary/gate-sync tests + 2 weak tests fixed), N2/N3/N4, C2
  (blocking gaps cap-at-Yellow / FSMA 204 Red gate). 54/54 tests. 397KB gzip.
- **Security:** clean (brand name escaped, PDF filename sanitized, offline).
- **Corrected an audit error:** src/retail-readiness-scorecard.html is the
  Vite source entry, not a build artifact.
- **Next review:** 2026-08-30.

### 2026-07-31 — Improvement pass (code review + UI review)

**Trigger:** User-initiated. Goal: verify the tool is CEO/CFO-ready; user
suspicious of all prior AI-written code.

**Reviewed:** scoring engine (vs YAML + score.py), flow engine, question
bank, UI renderers, PDF export, tests. Ran correctness/security/testing
reviewers + live browser run.

**Headline:** Scoring math is correct and matches the audited YAML/Python
exactly. All real issues are in the presentation layer.

**Fixing this arc:**
- [x] C1 — status-aware empty-state (screens.js + pdf.js, shared
      emptyStateText in scoring.js) + concrete findings on every "partial"
      primary-question branch. Verified live: Walmart OTIF=partial now shows
      "Red · 33%" with a real finding, not "No critical gaps."
- [x] I1 — getTopBlockers no longer pads with Greens; callout shows
      "Every dimension meets the bar" when all-clear. Verified live.
- [x] Intro copy — now names audience + Walmart/Costco/Whole Foods + output.
- [x] I4 — links now absolute https://lailarallc.com/… (target=_blank).
- [x] I2+I3 — added partial/boundary/hard-gate-near-miss/findings-invariant
      tests; fixed the 2 weak tests (real question bank + real verdict).
      48/48 passing.
- [x] N1 — corrected: src/retail-readiness-scorecard.html is the Vite source
      entry, NOT an artifact (kept). Removed untracked src/node_modules +
      src/dist cruft.
- [x] N2 — added gate-integrity test (every redGateValues gate scores Red 0).
- [x] N3 — brandMark() now escapes internally; callers pass raw values.
- [x] N4 — scripts/check-offline.mjs runs as postbuild; fails build on any
      external resource load. Passing.

**C2 — resolved (user decision 2026-07-31):**
- [x] Cap at Yellow: Item 360, EDI labels, Costco thermal. Hard Red gate:
      FSMA 204 (Walmart). Legend updated to explain caps. Verified live:
      Costco direct-thermal now "1 Gap to Close" / Fulfillment "Yellow · 75%"
      (was "Ready" / "Green · 75%").

**Next review:** 2026-08-30 (post-fix; project otherwise stable).

### 2026-09-23 — Audit (health check only)
- **Findings:** 0 critical, 5 important, 4 nice-to-have
- **Top concerns:** Local clone is parked on the already-merged client-mode-2026-08 branch with local main 13 commits behind origin/main, and HANDOFF/PLAN never recorded the Aug client-mode/parity/CI work (last review's 2026-08-30 date is overdue; cross-browser PDF check still open since May). client_mode.py preflight crashes with TypeError on non-string JSON values (list/dict) instead of producing a Data Readiness Report. README drifts from code (PDF filename, dist "gitignored" but tracked and stale since 2026-07-31). Scoring engine, JS/Python parity, and security are clean; 59 vitest + 3 parity + 14 client-mode tests pass.
- **Action taken:** Audit only — no fixes this session
- **Next review:** 2026-12-22
